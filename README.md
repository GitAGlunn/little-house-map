# little-house-map
 Local business would like a map to assist in analyzing and visualizing potential partnerships.

 They are evaluating Oregon retailers to determine their suitability as product distributors and have compiled a database with location information and other details. The ability to see said businesses mapped out with clear displays of key characteristics and the ability to sort/filter on that data would help them to make business decisions more effectively.

 This map will plot out retailers from the database, allowing them to easily classify businesses by area and identify top contenders. They would like to be able to view descriptions on hover/click and filter by three different fields from the dataset.

 The ability to edit the data through a web interface would also be a nice addition. That would assist them both in identifying new contacts as they grow and keeping track of already existing business deals and other metrics as they change over time.

 Data Action Plan: Data provided in an excel spreadsheet. Needs to be converted to geojson but has already undergone some manual cleanup/augmentation and is ready for use.
 Additional data (neighborhood information, property values and/or demographics) could also add value to the project.
